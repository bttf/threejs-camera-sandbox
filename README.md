# threejs-camera-sandbox

This is a sandbox application that let's you create and configure multiple Three.js Camera objects in a single Three.js Scene.

This is in effort to tinker with webgl camera configurations in order to gain a deeper understanding of how different parameters like field-of-view and aspect ratio affect the resulting image.

A work in progress.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
